Shall I compare thee to a summer day 
Thou art more lovely and more temperate
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May
And summer lease hath all too short a date
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
And often is his gold complexion dim
And every fair from fair sometimes declines
By chance or nature changing course untrimmed
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owe
Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade
When in eternal lines to time thou grow
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see
So long lives this and this gives life to thee
